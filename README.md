# Until Web App

Until is a useful and easy to explore events calendar, based on the
concepts of "until now" and "until then": immediacy, proximity, and
specificity.

Starting from two simple options, one choice, now or later:

Demands in life make it hard for you to plan for much more than spontaneous
outings and entertainment. Most of the time we either know when in the near
we're going to have some free time or we find ourselves with free time now.

What do we do? Do we read entire newspapers and collate event chronologies
in our minds? Visit several web sites and local forums which are pursuant
to your many and varied interests looking for what to do that might match
up with your requirements.

Event discovery, collation, and aggregation should be simplified and
genericized, and I should be able to easily view a chronological list
of local events that suit me.

There should be as few barriers as possible to event entry and event
acquisition, the system should even go so far as to harvest events from
remote sources by APIs, screen scraping, natural language processing, and
regular expression or grammars. We should take advantage of our competition,
as in the case with [R13 Team 346](https://github.com/railsrumble/r13-team-346)
aka [PugWarriors.com](http://pugwarriors.com/). Their events will happily be
harvested until...
